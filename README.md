# Python Project Folder: cms_star_rating_hospital_general_info_gather

## What this project does:
    
1. Opens CMS archive data site
2. Collects all revised flatfile zipped folders
3. Selects the most recent zipped folder for each year on the page
4. Reads the Hospital General Information.csv file within each year's zipped folder into pandas dataframe.
5. Creates new year column for each file
6. Renames some columns so all files are aligned
7. Unions all file dataframes together
8. Writes final dataframe to an excel file in the data folder.

* Includes 2 main python scripts:
  * cms_star_rating_hospital_general_information_downloader.py  (runs the main function)
  * helpers.py   (holds all necessary functions and imports necessary packages)

* Final Output:
  Should output an Excel file to the data folder which includes all revised flatfile "Hospital General Informationc.csv" file data for every year on 
  the *[archive page](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/hospitals)* excluding data for years 2015 and 2014.  2015 and 2014 are excluded because their
  Hospital General Information files only include hospital contact information rather than CMS Star Rating.
